<pre>
<b>Q1. Explain JDK, JRE and JVM? </b>
--> JDK is java development kit. It provides tools to compile and run java application. it  contains JRE & JVM.

JRE is java runtime environment. It provides environment to run java program.
end users Who just want to run a java program need JRE. 

JRE contains JVM  & Java Packages (like util, math, lang, awt, swing etc) & rt.jar 

JVM  converts byte-code to the machine readable form with help of JIT(Just In Time Compiler).  



<b>Q2. Why Java is platform independent?</b>

Java is called so because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.

<b>Q3. Why java is not 100% Object-oriented? </b>

Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive datatypes such as boolean,
byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.

we can avoid primitive datatypes and use Wrapper classes to 100% java application 100% object oriented. 


<b>Q4. What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton?</b>

Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. 
A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

<b>Q5. What is the difference between equals() and == ?</b>

<ol type="i">
<li>Main difference between .equals() method and == operator is that one is method and other is operator. </li>
<li>We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. </li>
<li>If a class does not override the equals method, then by default it uses equals(Object o) method of the closest 
parent class that has overridden this method. if no class has overridden equals(-) method then by default Object class
equals(-) method will come in picture and which internally uses == operator for comparison.
String class has it's own implementation i.e. overridden method equals which compares contents.
 </li>
</ol>

Example: 
	<code>
	    String s1 = new String("HELLO");
        String s2 = new String("HELLO");
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); //false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); //true
	</code>

<b>Q) What is Polymorphism? </b>

Representing one thing in many forms is Polymorphism.

There are 2 types of polymorphism, 

1) Compiletime/Static Polymorphism :- This can be achieved by using Method Overloading.

if there are two overloaded methods, then which method to be called is decided at compile time itself depending on parameter list. 

 
2) Runtime/Dynamic Polymorphism. :- This can be achieved by Method Overriding.

if there is overridden method in child class, then which method to be called is decided at runtime depending on reference of object.


<b>Q) What is association</b>
Association represents the relation between objects. or using association objects can communicate with each other.

there are 3 type of associations 1) IS-A 2) HAS-A 3) USES-A

1) IS-A :- if a class is inherited from other class then there is IS-A type of relation.

2) HAS-A :- if a class A is having object of another class B as a datamember then it is HAS-A type of relation.
it is also called composition. i.e. if there is no object A then there will not be object B.

System.out is example of HAS-A relationship.

3) USES-A :- if a method of a class is using object of another class then it is called as a USES-A relation.

<b>Q) What do you mean by aggregation & Composition? </b>
